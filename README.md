## Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

## What I learned

I learned that beside using position relative and absolute to make items overflow, I can also use grid to do do.

Also, the repeat(3, 1fr) for grid layout does not mean that it will divide the container into 3 equal parts, it really depends on the item in each part.
